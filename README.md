I've been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built my first Go project, "blogfuse". The consolidated toolchain makes me want to leave the JavaScript ecosystem behind for good.

I'm currently on the lookout for a role in backend web development, ideally writing Go. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight-knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
